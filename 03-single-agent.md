# Module 3: Single Agent Architecture with Semantic Kernel

**Duration**: 45 minutes  
**Objective**: Learn how to create intelligent conversational agents using Semantic Kernel's ChatCompletionAgent framework.

## Learning Outcomes
By completing this module, you will be able to:
- Create a ChatCompletionAgent that can hold conversations and use tools
- Configure agent personality through system instructions  
- Integrate plugins with agents for enhanced functionality
- Understand how agents automatically invoke functions based on conversation context
- Handle multi-turn conversations with built-in memory

## Prerequisites
- Completed [Module 2: Plugin Development](02-plugin-development.md)
- Understanding of SK fundamentals (Kernel, plugins, functions)

## Agent vs Function: The Key Difference

### ? Traditional Function Approach
```python
# Stateless, one-shot interactions
async def get_policy_info(policy_type: str) -> str:
    # Returns policy info but no conversation context
    return "Term Life: $50/month for $500K coverage"

# Each call is independent - no memory or conversation flow
result1 = await get_policy_info("life")  
result2 = await get_policy_info("health") 
# Agent doesn't remember first call when processing second
```

### ? Agent Approach - Conversational & Context-Aware
```python
from semantic_kernel.agents import ChatCompletionAgent
from semantic_kernel.contents.chat_history import ChatHistory

# Agent maintains conversation, uses tools automatically, remembers context
agent = ChatCompletionAgent(
    service_id="azure_openai",
    kernel=kernel,  # Kernel with plugins attached
    name="PolicyAgent", 
    instructions="You are a helpful insurance advisor..."
)

# Conversational flow with memory
chat_history = ChatHistory()
chat_history.add_user_message("I'm 35 and need life insurance")
response = await agent.invoke(chat_history)  # Agent remembers this context

chat_history.add_user_message("What would that cost me?") 
response = await agent.invoke(chat_history)  # Agent knows "that" refers to life insurance for 35-year-old
```

## Key Agent Framework Concepts

### 1. **System Instructions = Agent Personality**
The `instructions` parameter defines how your agent behaves:

```python
# Professional & Technical
instructions = "You are a technical insurance expert. Use precise calculations and industry terms."

# Friendly & Approachable  
instructions = "You are a friendly advisor. Use simple language and be patient with questions."

# Conservative & Cautious
instructions = "You prioritize protection. Always recommend comprehensive coverage."
```

### 2. **Automatic Tool Invocation**
With `FunctionCallBehavior.EnableFunctions(auto_invoke=True)`, the agent automatically calls functions when needed:

```python
# User says: "I'm 30 and need life insurance"
# Agent automatically calls find_life_policies(age=30) 

# User says: "What would $500K cost me?"
# Agent automatically calls calculate_premium(age=30, coverage_amount=500000)
```

### 3. **Built-in Memory with ChatHistory**
The agent remembers the entire conversation automatically:

```python
chat_history = ChatHistory()

# Turn 1
chat_history.add_user_message("I'm 30 and make $60K")
response = await agent.invoke(chat_history)

# Turn 2 - Agent remembers you're 30 and make $60K
chat_history.add_user_message("What coverage do I need?") 
response = await agent.invoke(chat_history)
```

---

## Different Agent Personalities

Here's how system instructions create different agent behaviors:

```python
# Conservative Agent
conservative_agent = ChatCompletionAgent(
    service_id="azure_openai",
    kernel=kernel,
    name="ConservativeAdvisor", 
    instructions="""You are a conservative insurance advisor focused on protection.
    
    APPROACH: Always recommend higher coverage amounts. Emphasize risks of being underinsured.
    TONE: Serious and professional. Use phrases like "protect your family" and "financial security"."""
)

# Budget-Friendly Agent
budget_agent = ChatCompletionAgent(
    service_id="azure_openai", 
    kernel=kernel,
    name="BudgetAdvisor",
    instructions="""You are practical and budget-conscious.
    
    APPROACH: Find affordable solutions. Suggest term over whole life. Provide cost-effective options.
    TONE: Understanding of budget constraints. Use phrases like "good value" and "smart choice"."""
)

# Technical Expert Agent
technical_agent = ChatCompletionAgent(
    service_id="azure_openai",
    kernel=kernel, 
    name="TechnicalExpert",
    instructions="""You are a technical insurance expert who loves data.
    
    APPROACH: Use precise calculations. Reference industry standards and actuarial data.
    TONE: Professional and analytical. Support recommendations with numbers and metrics."""
)
```

---

## Hands-On Exercise

Try modifying the agent's personality by changing the `instructions`:

```python
# Exercise: Create a "Beginner-Friendly" agent
beginner_friendly_instructions = """You are an insurance advisor who specializes in explaining things to people new to insurance.

PERSONALITY:
- Patient and encouraging  
- Never use jargon without explaining it
- Break complex topics into simple steps
- Celebrate when customers understand concepts

APPROACH:
- Ask one question at a time to avoid overwhelming
- Always explain why you're asking for information
- Use analogies to explain insurance concepts
- Confirm understanding before moving to next topic

Remember: This might be their first time buying insurance - make it a positive experience!"""
```

---

## Why This Approach Works

### ? **Conversational Flow**
- Agent maintains context throughout conversation
- No need to repeat information 
- Natural back-and-forth dialogue

### ? **Intelligent Tool Use** 
- Agent decides when to use functions based on conversation
- Automatic parameter extraction from user messages
- No manual function orchestration needed

### ? **Personality & Consistency**
- System instructions ensure consistent behavior
- Agent stays in character throughout conversation
- Customizable for different use cases

### ? **Built-in Memory**
- ChatHistory automatically manages conversation context
- Agent remembers all previous interactions
- No custom memory management required

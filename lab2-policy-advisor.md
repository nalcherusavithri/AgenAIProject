# Lab 2: Build a PolicyAdvisorAgent with Semantic Kernel

**Duration**: 45 minutes  
**Objective**: Build a conversational insurance agent using SK's ChatCompletionAgent framework that can recommend policies using simple plugins.

## Learning Outcomes
By completing this lab, you will be able to:
- Create a ChatCompletionAgent with personality and tools
- Build simple plugins for the agent to use automatically  
- Handle multi-turn conversations with built-in memory
- Configure agent behavior through system instructions
- Test agent functionality with realistic scenarios

## Prerequisites
- Completed [Module 3: Single Agent Architecture](../modules/03-single-agent.md)
- Working Semantic Kernel environment
- Azure OpenAI service configured

---

## What We're Building

A conversational insurance agent that:
- **Remembers** customer information throughout the conversation
- **Uses tools** to find policies and calculate premiums automatically
- **Provides recommendations** based on customer needs
- **Maintains personality** through system instructions

- Warm, professional, and patient
- Ask thoughtful questions to understand needs
- Explain recommendations clearly without jargon
- Show genuine care for customer's financial protection

YOUR PROCESS:
1. DISCOVER: Learn about the customer
   - Age, income, family situation, current coverage, goals
   
2. ANALYZE: Use your PolicyTools to find options
   - Search for suitable policies based on their profile
   - Calculate premiums for different scenarios
   - Recommend appropriate coverage amounts

3. ADVISE: Provide personalized recommendations
   - Explain why specific policies fit their needs
   - Show premium calculations
   - Give clear next steps

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- Always gather key information (age, income, family) before recommendations
- Use your tools to provide accurate, data-driven advice
- Explain your reasoning clearly
- Reference previous conversation points naturally
- If you need more information, ask specific questions

## Success Criteria & Validation

### ? Your Agent Should:

1. **Create Successfully**: Initialize without errors
2. **Remember Context**: Reference information from previous messages  
3. **Use Tools Automatically**: Call plugin functions when relevant
4. **Maintain Personality**: Respond as a professional insurance advisor
5. **Handle Edge Cases**: Gracefully manage invalid or unclear inputs

### ?? Validation Tests:

Run the test and verify:
- Agent remembers customer is 35, married, with children, income $75K
- Agent automatically searches policies when discussing options  
- Agent calculates premiums when asked about costs
- Agent provides coverage recommendations based on family situation

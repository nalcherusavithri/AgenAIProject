## Premium Calculation Basics

### Life Insurance Pricing Factors
```python
# Simplified life insurance premium calculation
def calculate_life_premium(age, coverage_amount, health_class="standard"):
    base_rate_per_1000 = 0.50  # Base rate per $1000 coverage
    
    # Age factor
    if age < 30:
        age_factor = 0.8
    elif age < 50:
        age_factor = 1.0
    else:
        age_factor = 1.0 + (age - 50) * 0.05
    
    # Health class factor
    health_factors = {
        "preferred_plus": 0.7,
        "preferred": 0.85,
        "standard": 1.0,
        "substandard": 1.5
    }
    
    health_factor = health_factors.get(health_class, 1.0)
    
    annual_premium = (coverage_amount / 1000) * base_rate_per_1000 * age_factor * health_factor
    return round(annual_premium, 2)
```

### Auto Insurance Factors
- **Driver Age**: Younger drivers pay more
- **Vehicle Type**: Sports cars cost more to insure
- **Location**: Urban areas typically cost more
- **Coverage Limits**: Higher limits cost more
- **Deductible**: Higher deductible = lower premium

### Home Insurance Factors
- **Home Value**: Higher value = higher premium
- **Construction Type**: Frame homes cost more than brick
- **Location**: Natural disaster risk affects pricing
- **Deductible**: Higher deductible = lower premium
- **Security Features**: Alarms, deadbolts may reduce premium

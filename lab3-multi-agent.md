# üîπ Lab 3: Multi-Agent System

**Duration**: 90 minutes  
**Objective**: Build and orchestrate multiple specialized insurance agents working together to provide comprehensive customer recommendations.

## üéØ Learning Outcomes
By completing this lab, you will be able to:
- Design and implement specialized agent architectures using Semantic Kernel
- Create agent orchestration systems for complex workflows
- Build collaborative decision-making systems with multiple agents
- Apply multi-agent patterns to real-world insurance scenarios
- Synthesize insights from multiple specialized agents

## üìã Prerequisites
- Completed [Lab 2: PolicyAdvisorAgent](lab2-policy-advisor.md)
- Understanding of [Module 4: Multi-Agent Systems](../modules/04-multi-agent.md)
- Working knowledge of async programming and ChatCompletionAgent

```

### Key Components We'll Build:
1. **CustomerAnalystAgent**: Extracts and analyzes customer needs and situation
2. **RiskSpecialistAgent**: Evaluates customer risk factors and calculates risk scores  
3. **ProductExpertAgent**: Recommends appropriate insurance products and features
4. **PolicyAdvisorAgent**: Provides final policy recommendations with pricing
5. **InsuranceAgentOrchestrator**: Coordinates the workflow between agents

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Symptoms | Solution |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **Agent Initialization Failed** | Agents not starting properly | Check Azure OpenAI credentials and deployment names |
| **Plugin Not Found** | Function calls failing | Ensure plugins are added to kernel before agent creation |
| **Analysis Incomplete** | Missing recommendations | Verify agent instructions and prompt structure |
| **Timeout Errors** | Long response times | Reduce analysis complexity or increase timeout |

### Debug Helper

```python
async def debug_multi_agent_system():
    """Debug multi-agent system issues"""
    
    print("üîß Debugging Multi-Agent System...")
    
    try:
        # Test kernel setup
        kernel = Kernel()
        service = AzureChatCompletion(
            service_id="azure_openai",
            deployment_name=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME"),
            endpoint=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"),
            api_key=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"),
            api_version=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION")
        )
        kernel.add_service(service)
        print("‚úÖ Kernel setup: OK")
        
        # Test individual agents
        customer_agent = CustomerAnalystAgent()
        await customer_agent.initialize(kernel)
        print("‚úÖ Customer agent: OK")
        
        # Test orchestrator
        orchestrator = InsuranceAgentOrchestrator()
        await orchestrator.initialize()
        print("‚úÖ Orchestrator: OK")
        
        # Test simple recommendation
        result = await orchestrator.get_comprehensive_recommendation("I'm 30, need insurance")
        print(f"‚úÖ Simple test: {type(result)}")
        
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"‚ùå Debug failed: {str(e)}")
        import traceback
        traceback.print_exc()

# Uncomment to run debug: asyncio.run(debug_multi_agent_system())
```

## üìö Next Steps

**üéâ Congratulations!** You've successfully built a complete multi-agent insurance system using Semantic Kernel.

**Key Achievements**:
- ‚úÖ Multi-agent architecture with specialized roles
- ‚úÖ Simple but effective orchestration pattern
- ‚úÖ Integration with Semantic Kernel ChatCompletionAgent
- ‚úÖ Real-world insurance application with comprehensive analysis

**Advanced Extensions** (Optional):
- Add more specialized agents (Underwriter, Compliance, etc.)
- Implement parallel agent processing for better performance
- Add persistent storage for customer profiles and recommendations
- Create a web interface for the multi-agent system
- Add conversation memory between agents

**Resources**:
- [Module 4: Multi-Agent Systems](../modules/04-multi-agent.md) - Deep dive theory
- [Semantic Kernel Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/) - Official documentation

# Module 4: Multi-Agent Systems with Semantic Kernel

**Duration**: 75 minutes  
**Objective**: Design and implement sophisticated multi-agent systems using Semantic Kernel's ChatCompletionAgent framework for complex insurance workflows with orchestration, communication, and collaborative decision-making.

## Learning Outcomes
By completing this module, you will be able to:
- Design multi-agent architectures using Semantic Kernel's agent framework
- Implement agent orchestration with multiple ChatCompletionAgents
- Create specialized agents with distinct personalities and responsibilities
- Build collaborative decision-making systems with agent communication
- Handle multi-agent coordination for policy recommendations
- Apply orchestration patterns for complex business processes

## Prerequisites
- Completed [Module 3: Single Agent Architecture](03-single-agent.md)
- Successfully completed [Lab 2: PolicyAdvisorAgent](../labs/lab2-policy-advisor.md)
- Understanding of ChatCompletionAgent framework
- Familiarity with async programming patterns

## Multi-Agent Architecture with Semantic Kernel

### When to Use Multiple Agents vs Single Agent

**Single Agent** ✅ for:
- Simple, focused conversations
- Single domain expertise
- Straightforward question-answer workflows

**Multi-Agent** ✅ for:
- Complex decision-making requiring different perspectives
- Specialized expertise areas working together
- Scenarios where multiple viewpoints add value
- Collaborative analysis and recommendations

### Agent Specialization Strategy

For policy recommendations, we leverage multiple specialized agents:
- **👥 Emma (Customer Analyst)**: Understands customer needs and situation
- **🔬 Dr. Martinez (Risk Specialist)**: Evaluates risk factors and categories  
- **🎯 Alex (Product Expert)**: Knows all available insurance products
- **💰 Jordan (Pricing Analyst)**: Calculates accurate premium estimates

### 🎯 **Agent Specializations**

| Agent | Symbol | Role | Key Functions | Output |
|-------|--------|------|---------------|---------|
| **Emma** | 👥 | Customer Analyst | Needs assessment, coverage calculation | Coverage amount, priorities |
| **Dr. Martinez** | 🔬 | Risk Specialist | Health/lifestyle evaluation, risk scoring | Risk category, premium impact |
| **Alex** | 🎯 | Product Expert | Product matching, feature comparison | Product recommendations |
| **Jordan** | 💰 | Pricing Analyst | Premium calculation, affordability | Cost estimates, value analysis |

## Key Multi-Agent Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. **Agent Specialization**

Each agent has a distinct area of expertise:

```python
# Customer Analyst - Understands needs and situation
CustomerAnalystAgent() → Coverage needs, life situation analysis

# Risk Specialist - Evaluates risk factors  
RiskSpecialistAgent() → Health, occupation, lifestyle risks

# Product Expert - Knows all insurance products
ProductExpertAgent() → Policy types, features, comparisons

# Pricing Analyst - Calculates accurate costs
PricingAnalystAgent() → Premium estimates, affordability analysis
```

### 2. **Collaborative Analysis**

Multiple agents analyze the same customer from different perspectives:

```python
# Each agent provides specialized insight
customer_insight = customer_analyst.analyze_customer(profile, request)
risk_insight = risk_specialist.analyze_customer(profile, request)  
product_insight = product_expert.analyze_customer(profile, request)
pricing_insight = pricing_analyst.analyze_customer(profile, request)

# Orchestrator synthesizes all insights
final_recommendation = synthesize_recommendations(all_insights)
```

### 3. **Simplified Coordination**

No complex handoffs - agents work independently then combine results:

```python
# Simple coordination pattern
analyses = {}
for role, agent in self.agents.items():
    analyses[role] = await agent.analyze_customer(profile, request)

# Synthesize results from all agents
return self._synthesize_recommendations(analyses, profile)
```

### 4. **Specialized Tools per Agent**

Each agent has domain-specific plugins:

```python
CustomerAnalysisPlugin() → assess_coverage_needs(), prioritize_insurance_needs()
RiskAnalysisPlugin() → calculate_risk_score(), assess_health_factors()
ProductAnalysisPlugin() → recommend_product_types(), compare_policy_features()
PricingAnalysisPlugin() → calculate_premium_estimate(), affordability_analysis()
```

---

## Benefits of This Multi-Agent Approach

### ✅ **Specialized Expertise**
- Each agent focuses on their area of strength
- Deeper analysis in each domain
- More accurate recommendations

### ✅ **Comprehensive Coverage**
- Customer needs from multiple angles
- Risk factors thoroughly evaluated  
- Product options fully explored
- Costs accurately estimated

### ✅ **Simple Architecture**
- No complex agent handoffs
- Independent agent analysis
- Clean synthesis of results
- Easy to understand and maintain

### ✅ **Scalable Design**
- Easy to add new specialist agents
- Agents can be enhanced independently
- Clear separation of concerns

## Multi-Agent vs Single Agent for Policy Recommendations

| Aspect | Single Agent | Multi-Agent System |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Expertise Depth** | General knowledge | Deep specialized knowledge |
| **Analysis Quality** | Good overall | Excellent in each domain |
| **Recommendation Accuracy** | Solid | Highly accurate |
| **System Complexity** | Simple | Moderate |
| **Maintenance** | Easy | Modular and manageable |
| **Best For** | Simple recommendations | Complex policy decisions |

---

## Success Criteria

By completing this module, you should be able to:

✅ **Design multi-agent systems** with specialized roles for policy recommendations  
✅ **Implement agent coordination** without complex handoff mechanisms  
✅ **Create domain-specific agents** with specialized tools and expertise  
✅ **Synthesize insights** from multiple agents into comprehensive recommendations  
✅ **Apply orchestration patterns** for collaborative decision-making  
✅ **Understand when multi-agent approaches add value** over single agents

## Next Steps

**Ready to build your own multi-agent system!**

**Next**: [Lab 3: Multi-Agent System](../labs/lab3-multi-agent.md) - Implement this multi-agent architecture hands-on!

**Key Takeaways**:
- Multi-agent systems excel when different specialized expertise is needed
- Agents can work independently and have their results synthesized
- Specialization leads to higher quality analysis and recommendations  
- Simple coordination often works better than complex handoff mechanisms
- Each agent should have clear, focused responsibilities
- Orchestrators synthesize multiple perspectives into final recommendations

**Advanced Applications**:
- Add more specialist agents (compliance, underwriting, etc.)
- Implement agent voting on recommendations
- Create confidence scoring across agents
- Add real-time policy database integration
